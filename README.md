# WaterToxicityProject
1) Business Process: Monitoring water toxicity levels across various locations.

2) Requirements: Determine average toxicity levels for different stations. Identify the most common contaminants (analytes). Analyze trends in water quality over time.

3) Get Data and Profiling: Gather data on toxicity levels, analyte concentrations, collection times, and station details. Profile data for quality and consistency.

4) Data Sources: Toxicity test results from various stations and dates. Environmental conditions at the time of sample collection.

5) Dimensional Modeling
