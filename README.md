# WaterToxicityProject
1) Business Process: Monitoring water toxicity levels across various locations.

2) Requirements: Determine average toxicity levels for different stations. Identify the most common contaminants (analytes). Analyze trends in water quality over time.

3) Get Data and Profiling: Gather data on toxicity levels, analyte concentrations, collection times, and station details. Profile data for quality and consistency.

4) Data Sources: Toxicity test results from various stations and dates. Environmental conditions at the time of sample collection.

5) Dimensional Modeling

Data source:

The surface water toxicity results are sourced from the California Environmental Data Exchange Network (CEDEN), a data system of the California State Water Board that collects and compiles surface water quality data from across California. This includes field, sediment, and water column data from various environments, contributed by both research and volunteer organizations.
