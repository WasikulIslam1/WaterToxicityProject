# WaterToxicityProject
1) Business Process: Monitoring water toxicity levels across various locations.

2) Requirements: Determine average toxicity levels for different stations. Identify the most common contaminants (analytes). Analyze trends in water quality over time.

3) Get Data and Profiling: Gather data on toxicity levels, analyte concentrations, collection times, and station details. Profile data for quality and consistency.

4) Data Sources: Toxicity test results from various stations and dates. Environmental conditions at the time of sample collection.

5) Dimensional Modeling

The surface water toxicity results on the California Open Data website come from the California Environmental Data Exchange Network (CEDEN), a comprehensive data system of the California State Water Board. It aggregates surface water quality data from across California, including field, sediment, and water column data from diverse environments, provided by research and volunteer organizations.
